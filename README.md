# MESSAGING-SYSTEM-RABBITMQ

1️⃣ Strengths

✅ Clear project description and objective.

✅ Comprehensive system architecture and workflow explanation.

✅ Step-by-step implementation instructions.

✅ Detailed testing procedure and deliverables.

✅ Lists technologies used and references for learning resources.

2️⃣ Areas for Improvement

Formatting for GitHub

Use Markdown headings (#, ##, ###) and code blocks (bash or python) for commands and examples.

Lists and sublists can be indented with - or * for better readability.

Consistency

Endpoints are written as ?sendmail=<recipient_email>; make it consistent with /action?sendmail=<email> everywhere.

Keep terminology consistent (e.g., “task queue manager” vs “task queue”).

Technical Accuracy / Clarity

Logging is described as synchronous, but in the architecture section, it says it demonstrates asynchronous processing. Clarify the difference.

Consider explicitly mentioning environment variables for SMTP credentials in implementation and .env file usage.

Learning Resources

The “Before we start today…” section could be moved to a References / Learning Resources section.

Format them as bullet points with links where possible.

Polish / Grammar

Some minor grammatical improvements:

“Before we start today's project this is what you''ll be learning;” → “Before starting this project, you will learn:”

“Demonstrates synchronous logging functionality” → “Logs current server timestamps (can also be adapted as asynchronous tasks)”

3️⃣ Suggested README Structure

Here’s how I would structure it for GitHub readability:

# Messaging System with RabbitMQ, Celery, Nginx, and Python

## 1. Objective
Build a simple messaging system demonstrating asynchronous task processing using RabbitMQ and Celery. The system exposes endpoints to:
- Send an email asynchronously via SMTP.
- Log the current server time.

## 2. System Architecture

### Frontend (Nginx Reverse Proxy)
- Nginx listens on port 80 and forwards HTTP requests to the Python app (Gunicorn/Uvicorn).  
- Provides clean, production-like request routing.

### Backend (Python Application)
- Flask or FastAPI provides two endpoints:
  - `/action?sendmail=<email>` → Sends email via Celery.  
  - `/action?talktome` → Logs the current server time.  

### Task Queue (Celery + RabbitMQ)
- RabbitMQ is the message broker.  
- Celery workers process tasks in the background:
  - `send_email_task` → Sends email.  
  - `log_time_task` → Logs current time.  

### External Exposure (Ngrok)
- Ngrok tunnels the local Nginx server to a public HTTPS endpoint for testing.

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Email Sending**: Accepts email as parameter, tasks handled asynchronously.  
- **Logging Time**: Logs server timestamp to `app.log`. Can also be adapted for asynchronous execution.

## 4. Implementation Steps
1. Install Dependencies: RabbitMQ, Celery, Flask/FastAPI, Gunicorn/Uvicorn, Nginx, Ngrok.  
2. Start RabbitMQ locally.  
3. Configure Celery and define tasks.  
4. Develop Python application routes.  
5. Configure SMTP credentials via environment variables.  
6. Deploy behind Nginx.  
7. Run ngrok to expose public endpoint.

## 5. Testing Procedure
- **Send Email**:  
  ```bash
  https://<ngrok-id>.ngrok.io/action?sendmail=test@example.com


Expected: Email sent asynchronously.

Log Time:

https://<ngrok-id>.ngrok.io/action?talktome


Expected: Current time appended to app.log.

6. Deliverables

Working system accessible via ngrok.

Screen recording showing:

RabbitMQ running locally.

Celery workers processing tasks.

Flask/Nginx responding to requests.

Emails sent successfully.

Log file updated.

7. Technologies Used

RabbitMQ, Celery, Flask/FastAPI, Gunicorn/Uvicorn, Nginx, SMTP, Ngrok, Python 3.9+

8. Conclusion

Demonstrates asynchronous task processing, reverse proxying, and background job execution. System is accessible externally via ngrok.
